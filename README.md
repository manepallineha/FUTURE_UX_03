# Event Photography CRM Dashboard UI

## Project Overview
This project is a UI design for an Event Photography Agency CRM system created using Canva.  
The dashboard helps photography agencies manage leads, bookings, clients, and payments efficiently through a structured and user-friendly interface.

## Objective
To design a clean and professional CRM dashboard that:
- Tracks client inquiries
- Manages booking workflow
- Displays revenue and performance metrics
- Improves team coordination

## Features

-  KPI Overview Cards (Total Bookings, Revenue, New Leads, Upcoming Shoots)
-  Lead Pipeline (New Inquiry → Contacted → Proposal Sent → Booked → Completed)
-  Client Profile Page
-  Upcoming Shoots Section
-  Sidebar Navigation for easy access

## Workflow Logic

The dashboard follows the real-world workflow of an event photography agency:

1. New Inquiry  
2. Contacted  
3. Proposal Sent  
4. Booked  
5. Completed  

This Kanban-style structure allows agencies to visually track client progress and avoid missed follow-ups.

## How It Improves Efficiency
